/*! \page categories Applet categories

\section description Description

Applets are organized in a menu hierarchy, which is formed from applet
categories. Applet categories are stored in ini format files under

\code
    /usr/share/duicontrolpanel/categories/*.cpcategory
\endcode

\section catapplets Categorizing applets

\subsection appletCat Specifying a category for an applet
Each applet specifies in which category it should appear. For this an applet is
using the "Category" key in its .desktop file.

A category can be referred by its name or the logical id of its name. To get all
such ids you can use:
\code
    grep '^Name' /usr/share/duicontrolpanel/categories/*
\endcode

These are the categories shipping with controlpanel:

\htmlinclude defaultcategories.html

\subsection wrong Wrong category identifiers
Applets specifying no or wrong category identifiers as the category they belong
to, would just disappear.
To avoid this, there can be categories (currently the Applications category)
which is flagged to display all applets. To do so, the category should also have
the special alias "Uncategorized".

\section format Category description format

\par Parent
The parent of the category. The category will be displayed as a submenu of
its parent.

\par Name
The name of the category. The category can be identified by its name, and
additionally also suits for the engineering english translation (when no
translation is available).

\par Name-logical-id
The translation id of the category's name. It can also be used to identify
the category.

\par Value
A second line of text that is shown on the launch button representing the
category. (engineering translation)

\par Value-logical-id
The translation id of Value.

\par Icon
The icon of the launch button representing the category.

\par Aliases
Other names for identifying the category. Its goal is to provide compatibility
in case the Name changes. If "Uncategorized" appears as an alias here, the
category will also contain applets with no / wrong category identifiers.

\par Translation-catalogs
The list of translation catalogs which are needed for the title/subtitle
of the category.

\par Order
A number which will determine the position of the launch button in the
category list. Lower numbers will be on upper positions (closer to top),
higher numbers will be at the bottom.

\par ComponentOrder
The category both contains applets and other categories.
This key defines the sequence of those in the
list which represents the category content. If it has the value
"AppletsFirst", the list will contain the applets above the categories.
If it contains any other value ("CategoriesFirst", the default), the
categories will be above the applets.

\par AppletSort
Defines the way the applets in the category are sorted.
Its value can be "SortByTitle" or "SortByOrder" (default). First one means that
the applets will be sorted by their translated title, second is that the
applets themselves defines their sequence through the "Order" key in their
.desktop file.

\par AutoStartApplet
This key can override applet autostarting.
If it has the value "1", autostart is on, in which case the applet list will not
be shown for the user if the category has only 1 applet, but instead, the applet
will be opened directly. Default value is "0", by default autostarting is
disabled.

Example:
\code
Parent=MainPage

Name=Applications
Name-logical-id=qtn_sett_main_applications

Value="Installations, Application settings"
Value-logical-id=qtn_sett_main_applictions_label2

Icon=icon-m-settings-applications

Aliases=Uncategorized
Translation-catalogs=

Order=30
\endcode
